> SOME BASIC GIT GUIDELINES TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER
> 
> - Always develop on a new branch, don't develop on Master. The content of the Master-branch will go live on `differentdesigners.nl` directly.
> - Always Pull Request (PR), never merge directly.
> - Never merge your own PR unless you're 100% sure of what you're doing and you verified the change with the team — unless it's your own branch/prototype of course. 
> - Dare to make mistakes on your branches, that's were Git is for: solving fuck-ups by doing a rollback — it's gonna be okay (I wrecked my whole Shortcuts codebase once by accidentally merging in Master at 1AM, _nothing on the hand_ because of Git)
> - Ask questions when you don't have any clue wtf you're doing; I still don't know what I'm doing either and we're all here to learn.
> - Don't push to Master on Friday. On Friday we smile, don't do (too much) drug and drink quality (!!) beer.
